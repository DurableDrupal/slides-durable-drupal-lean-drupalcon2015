It’s Tuesday and Rick, Mark, Olga, and Arti are standing at the whiteboard , looking at a wireframe that they’ve drawn. Arti has a marker in her hand, but she’s not drawing. “Rick, I don’t understand what you’re driving at. Can you explain the problem?” Rick takes the marker, wipes clear a section of the board, and explains the regulation again. The team is designing an app for stock traders, and the app has to obey a strict set of regulations. Rick, the business analyst, is responsible for making sure that the team’s designs support the rules. After a while, the team is nodding, and Arti takes the marker again. She suggests a change to the wireframe design of the app on the board and the team nods again. They all take out their iPhones, take photos of the board, and agree to reconvene the next day. They’re confident that what they’ve agreed on will be ready for user testing on Thursday. Arti, the designer, goes back to her desk to start detailing the design they’ve sketched. Mark, the front-end developer, starts building the page — he uses premade components from the living style guide the team has put in place, so he doesn’t need to wait for Arti before getting the basic pieces in place. Rick opens the project’s wiki and begins to document the decisions the team has made about the application behavior. He’ll review these choices with the product owner later in the day. And Olga, the QA tester, begins the process of writing tests for the new section of the app.
